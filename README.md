This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for practical implementations of wireless communication techniques, focusing on MIMO, fading channels, and detection methods.
Notebooks Overview
## 1. MIMO Channel with Coherent Detection (MIMO_Channel_Coherent_Det.ipynb)<br>

 -   Simulates coherent detection in MIMO wireless systems.<br>
 -   Assumes knowledge of channel state information (CSI).<br>
  -  Evaluates Bit Error Rate (BER) under different fading conditions.<br>

## 2. Non-Coherent Detection in Fading Channel (Non_Coherent_Detection_in_fading_channel.ipynb)

   - Implements non-coherent detection techniques for fading channels.<br>
   - Does not require explicit CSI for signal recovery.<br>
  -  Useful in scenarios where channel estimation is impractical.<br>

## 3. Fading Coefficient Squared Magnitude PDF Over Time (fading_coeff_squaredmag_pdf_time.ipynb)

  -  Analyzes the statistical distribution of fading coefficients.<br>
  -  Computes and plots the PDF (Probability Density Function) of the squared magnitude of fading over time.<br>
  -  Provides insights into fading behavior for wireless system design.<br>

## 4. Coherent Detection with Fading Channel (Coherent_Detection_with_fading_channel.ipynb)

   - Simulates coherent detection in a fading channel environment.<br>
    - Assumes the receiver has perfect CSI.<br>
   - Compares fading models and their impact on detection performance.<br>
